# validate-who2-catalogue
Data and code to validate our translation of the [second version of the WHO catalogue](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082410) of resistance-associated variants in tuberculosis as deployed in [EIT Pathogena](https://www.eit-pathogena.com). 

This repository complements a manuscript that will shortly be deposited on a preprint server with the aim of being submitted to a scientific journal for peer-review. Once those details are known this README will be updated.
